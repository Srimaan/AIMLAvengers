# AIMLAvengers ‚Äì Python Learning Repository (with Java Comparisons)

Welcome to the AIMLAvengers learning repository!  
This project is organized to help you learn **Python from scratch**, especially if you're coming from a **Java background**.

Each Python file includes:
- ‚úÖ Clean and modern Python code
- üîÅ Java equivalents for comparison (inline or block)
- üß™ Expected output as comments
- üß≠ Numbered files for learning in logical order
